    <h1> About our test </h1>
    <p style="text-align: left">
    The Braunaghatta Personality Test (BPT) was constructed over the course
    of over 15 years of research, and was further developed as part of an international
    collaborative effort by the world's most impactful cognitive and psycho-social
    science laboratories. Since its publication, this test has quickly
    become widely accepted as the field standard. While it shares a bit of foundational
    theory with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and the Newcastle Personality
    Assessor (NPA), the BPT is fundamentally revolutionary in that it utilizes modern
    day advancements in machine learning and artificial neural networks in order
    to construct a powerfully accurate and in-depth analysis of the test subject's
    psyche. As of today, over 200 scholarly articles have been written on the theory
    behind the BPT. We hope you enjoy taking our assessment and learning more
    about yourself.
